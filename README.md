# Students Math Marks Project

This is a ML project which predicts math marks in the final period exam of different students in two different schools based on various features like absences,studyhours,family size,family support, alcohol consumption etc. This project idea fascinated me as a lot of students, especially college students drink a lot and it was interesting to predict theie marks based on it, though it is one of many aspects.

## Description
As mentioned earlier, the purpose of the project is to predict math marks of students based on different factors of their student life. The dataset used in the project has following factors as features in it:
1. Academic : 
    1. School name
    2. Absences
    3. Study hours
    4. Extra paid classes
    5. School support
    6. Free time
    7. Failures
    8. Studied nursery or not
    9. Reason for education
    10. grades in previous two periods.
2. Family related : 
    1. Family size
    2. Parents' jobs
    3. Parents' education
    4. Family cohabitation status
    5. family support.
3. Leisure : 
    1. Going out frequency
    2. Workday and weekend alcohol consumption.
4. Personal : 
    1. Age
    2. Sex
    3. Address
    4. Relationship status(romantic)
    5. Internet connectivity.

These features give almost every possible detail of a student. Using these features to predict marks gives an insight into a student's academic success, showing how students follow different behaviour pattern and yet score same mark.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle. Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption/download) to download the dataset for a preview.
